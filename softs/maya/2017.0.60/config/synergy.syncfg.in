<!-- Schema version 1 description
   The document must be contained in a "SynHubConfig" element, with the
   SchemaVersion used.

   The root element can contain an arbitrary number of "Application" elements,
   each describing an appliaction that will be known to programes using SynHub.

   The "Application" element is made of a few attributes:

      Name [String]: Application name (e.g.: "Softimage").  Case is important.
      The name can contain spaces (e.g.: "3ds Max" ).

      StringVersion [String]: Describes the version in a user-readable way
      (e.g.: "2011 extension 1 beta 3").  Will not be interpreted by the
      application but may end up being displayed in an information panel.

      NumericVersion [String]:  Used for sorting, e.g. finding the latest
      application.  Must be an integer of the form a.b.c.d.  The number of
      levels has a limit of 4 but there can be fewer (the others are understood
      to be zero).

      Architecture [String]: x86_32 or x86_64.  The executable's target
      architecture.

      StartWrapperPath [String]: Optional.  Path for a wrapper script/executable
      to use when starting the executable.  This is to accomodate situations
      where parts of the configuration are made in wrapper scripts to set
      environment variables before launching the program per se.

      ExecutablePath [String]: Path for the executable.  Can be relative, in
      which case the path is relative to the config file's location.

      IconPath [String]: Optional.  Path to an icon that can be used to
      represent the application in a user interface.
